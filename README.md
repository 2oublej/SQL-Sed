# SQL-Sed
Capitalizes SQL reserved words by applying sed search and replace on a given .sql file
by running the sedtest.sh script it'll search for the given .sql file in the directory and then capitalize all the SQL reserved words (a backup file with .bak extension will be created in the same directory containing the original file in case you want to revert changes made by the script).
